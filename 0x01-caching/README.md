# 0x01-caching
In this project I will be learning about cache algorithms.
Cache algorithms are optmizing instructions, or algorithms, that a computer program or hardware-maintained structure can utilize in order to manage a cache of information stored on the computer.
## Cache
Hardware or software components that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster, the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsehere.
Objects:
- FIFO - First In First Out
- LIFO - Last In Last Out
- LRU - Least Recently Used
- MRU - Most Recently Used
- LFU - Least Frequenlty Used
- Purpose of the caching system
- Limits of a caching system
